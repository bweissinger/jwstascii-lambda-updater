            <p>NASA’s Webb Telescope has revealed the cloak of dust around the second star, shown at
                left in red, at the center of the Southern Ring Nebula for the first time. It is a
                hot, dense <a
                    href="https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-af018baf-1434-4fac-83cd-166b33535761"
                    target="_self">white dwarf star</a>.</p>
            <p>As it transformed into a white dwarf, the star periodically ejected mass – the shells
                of material you see here. As if on repeat, it contracted, heated up – and then,
                unable to push out more material, pulsated.</p>
            <p>At this stage, it should have shed its last layers. So why is the red star still
                cloaked in dust? Was material transferred from its companion? Researchers will begin
                to pursue answers soon.</p>
            <p>The bluer star at right in this image has also shaped the scene. It helps stir up the
                ejected material. The disk around the stars is also wobbling, shooting out spirals
                of gas and dust over long periods of time. This scene is like witnessing a rotating
                sprinkler that’s finished shooting out material in all directions over thousands of
                years.</p>
            <p>Webb captured this scene in mid-infrared light – most of which can only be observed
                from space. Mid-infrared light helps researchers detect objects enshrouded in dust,
                like the red star.</p>

                    target="_self">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) image also offers an
                incredible amount of detail, including a cache of distant galaxies in the
                background. Most of the multi-colored points of light are galaxies, not stars. Tiny
                triangles mark the circular edges of stars, including a blue one within the nebula’s
                red bottom-most edges, while galaxies look like misshapen circles, straight lines,
                and spirals.</p>

            <p><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a
                    consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European
                    Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em></p>
