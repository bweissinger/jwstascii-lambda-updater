                NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has produced the deepest and sharpest infrared
                image of the distant universe to date. Known as Webb’s First Deep Field, this image
                of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thousands of galaxies – including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared
                – have appeared in Webb’s view for the first time. This slice of the vast universe
                is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the
                ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                This deep field, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made
                from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours – achieving depths at
                infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope’s deepest fields, which took
                weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.
                The combined mass of this galaxy cluster acts as a

                , magnifying much more distant galaxies behind it. Webb’s NIRCam has brought those
                distant galaxies into sharp focus – they have tiny, faint structures that have never
                been seen before, including star clusters and diffuse features. Researchers will
                soon begin to learn more about the galaxies’ masses, ages, histories, and
                compositions, as Webb seeks the earliest galaxies in the universe.

                    The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory.
                    Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds
                    around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our
                    universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with
                    its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).
