            <p>An enormous mosaic of Stephan’s Quintet is the largest image to date from NASA’s
                James Webb Space Telescope, covering about one-fifth of the Moon’s diameter. It
                contains over 150 million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000 separate image
                files. The visual grouping of five galaxies was captured by Webb’s <a
                    href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP"
                    target="_self">Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam)</a> and <a
                    href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1"
                    target="_self">Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)</a>.</p>
            <p>With its powerful, infrared vision and extremely high spatial resolution, Webb shows
                never-before-seen details in this galaxy group. Sparkling clusters of millions of
                young stars and starburst regions of fresh star birth grace the image. Sweeping
                tails of gas, dust and stars are being pulled from several of the galaxies due to
                gravitational interactions. Most dramatically, Webb’s MIRI instrument captures huge
                shock waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashes through the cluster. These
                regions surrounding the central pair of galaxies are shown in the colors red and
                gold.</p>
            <p>This composite NIRCam-MIRI image uses two of the three MIRI filters to best show and
                differentiate the hot dust and structure within the galaxy. MIRI sees a distinct
                difference in color between the dust in the galaxies versus the shock waves between
                the interacting galaxies. The image processing specialists at the Space Telescope
                Science Institute in Baltimore opted to highlight that difference by giving MIRI
                data the distinct yellow and orange colors, in contrast to the blue and white colors
                assigned to stars at NIRCam’s wavelengths.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Together, the five galaxies of Stephan’s Quintet are also known as the Hickson
                Compact Group 92 (HCG 92). Although called a “quintet,” only four of the galaxies
                are truly close together and caught up in a cosmic dance. The fifth and leftmost
                galaxy, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four. NGC
                7320 resides 40 million light-years from Earth, while the other four galaxies (NGC
                7317, NGC 7318A, NGC 7318B, and NGC 7319) are about 290 million light-years away.
                This is still fairly close in cosmic terms, compared with more distant galaxies
                billions of light-years away. Studying these relatively nearby galaxies helps
                scientists better understand structures seen in a much more distant universe.</p>
            <p>This proximity provides astronomers a ringside seat for witnessing the merging of and
                interactions between galaxies that are so crucial to all of galaxy evolution. Rarely
                do scientists see in so much exquisite detail how interacting galaxies trigger star
                formation in each other, and how the gas in these galaxies is being disturbed.
                Stephan’s Quintet is a fantastic “laboratory” for studying these processes
                fundamental to all galaxies.</p>
            <p>Tight groups like this may have been more common in the early universe when their
                superheated, infalling material may have fueled very energetic black holes called
                quasars. Even today, the topmost galaxy in the group – NGC 7319 – harbors an <a
                    href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei"
                    target="_self">active galactic nucleus</a>, a supermassive black hole that is
                actively accreting material.</p>
            <p>In NGC 7320, the leftmost and closest galaxy in the visual grouping, NIRCam was
                remarkably able to resolve individual stars and even the galaxy’s bright core. Old,
                dying stars that are producing dust clearly stand out as red points with NIRCam.</p>
            <p>The new information from Webb provides invaluable insights into how galactic
                interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the early universe.</p>
            <p>As a bonus, NIRCam and MIRI revealed a vast sea of many thousands of distant
                background galaxies reminiscent of Hubble’s Deep Fields.</p>
            <p><em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s
                    Advanced Technology Center.</em></p>
            <p><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a
                    consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European
                    Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em></p>
